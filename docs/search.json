I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at Witten/Herdecke University. Previously, I was a PhD candidate at Aarhus University, Department of Political Science.\nIn my dissertation, I study the determinants and the consequences of legislators’ efforts to represent local constituents through parliamentary activities. My research interests include parliaments, party politics, and electoral systems. Methodologically, I am interested in quantitative text analysis and causal inference.\nYou can contact me at edoardo.vigano@uni-wh.de.
