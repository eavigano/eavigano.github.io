I have experience teaching courses both at the bachelor and at the master's level at Aarhus University.

-   MA course: [Electoral Systems: Do They Really Matter?](https://kursuskatalog.au.dk/en/course/113493/223E22-Electoral-Systems-Do-They-Really-Matter) (course convenor and lecturer). [Syllabus](electoral_systems.pdf).

-   BA course: [Political Institutions: Western Countries, EU, and Foreign Policy](https://kursuskatalog.au.dk/en/course/110302/Political-Institutions-Western-Countries-EU-and-Foreign-Policy) (teaching assistant).

I have also experience supervising students in individual seminars, where they are asked to produce a long essay.
