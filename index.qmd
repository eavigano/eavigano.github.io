::: {#main-part}
Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at Witten/Herdecke University. Previously, I was a PhD candidate at Aarhus University, Department of Political Science.

In my dissertation, I study the determinants and the consequences of legislators' efforts to represent local constituents through parliamentary activities. My research interests include parliaments, party politics, electoral systems, and political violence. Methodologically, I am interested in quantitative text analysis and causal inference.

You can contact me at [eaviganoac\@gmail.com](mailto:eaviganoac@gmail.com). My CV can be downloaded [here](cv.pdf).
